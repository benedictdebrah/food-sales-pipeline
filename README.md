# Pizza Sales Data Engineering Pipeline

This project aims to build a data engineering pipeline for a fictional company, PaaSales, in the food sales industry. The pipeline automates the process of uploading raw JSON data, cleaning and transforming the database, and regularly updating it for the analytics team. The goal is to ensure reliable and usable data with minimal human intervention.



## About the Data

The data consists of JSON files containing information on food sales transactions, customer details, and other relevant metrics. These files are processed and transformed to create a clean and updated database, which serves as a source of truth for the analytics team.
